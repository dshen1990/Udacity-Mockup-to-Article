1. I learnt the three new elements like superscript,horizontal rule, and strikethrough. I can bulid a web page all by myself.
2. The HTML is not so hard as I thought before. Elements are easy to learn.The HTML tree is easy to understand too.
3. The new elements are a little bit diffcult if you do not know the name of the element or what the new element look like.
